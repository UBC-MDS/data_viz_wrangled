# Key Capabilities: Data Visualization Wrangled Data from Students for Final Project 

Here lies the data given from students in the Key Capabilities in Data Science: Data Visualization Course.     
This repository has been created to give students a url for their wrangled data to lower the storage space of their final project files. 
The students have granted us permission for their data to live here and they understand it is shared publicly.    

## Data Options
For this project, students can choose between the following datasets stored as csv files located in a data folder of the final_project directory:
